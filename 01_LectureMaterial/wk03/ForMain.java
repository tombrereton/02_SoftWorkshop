/* 
 * 
 * A for loop is similar to a while loop, however, in the round brackets
 * we declare and initialize an iteration variable, separate by a semicolon the
 * termination condition and again by a semicolon the update expression for the
 * iteration variable.
 * 
 * Again in order to understand non-trivial for loops we need to give an
 * invariant, that is, a boolean expression which is true before the loop
 * is entered and is true again after each execution of the body in
 * full. That is, it is also true if and when the loop terminates.
 * 
 * In order to guarantee the termination of a for loop we consider the
 * iteration variable and make sure that it is firstly bounded (from
 * below or above) and secondly that it is either decreased or increased
 * (resp.) by at least 1 by each execution of the loop.
 * 
 * Careful, better test for <= or >= than for == or !=. Take also care
 * that if you take a bound from below (above) that the expression is
 * actually decreasing (increasing, resp.).
